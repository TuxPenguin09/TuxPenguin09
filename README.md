# About Me
## Heyo, It's TuxPenguin09 (aliamanuba on any site) and just my true name is Moritz
### Just your average advanced web developer.
I mostly work more on my portfolio project and its core behind it.
You can also contribute to my portfolio site documentation for developers for developing an application in my portfolio site, [hodots. Documentations for Developers](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/hodots-docs).
How about my multipurpose [code editor](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/incogine-editor).

# Questions Answered
## Programming Languages I knew?
- Also I highly love JavaScript as my main programming language and Python as second which is what I use for Developing Sites, Backend Server, Socket Server, Hosting, etc.
- I used to do C# from the past 2017 for my game development using Unity 3D.
- Still Learning C++ for my game engine from scratch and it was pain at first just for Math and everything.
- I'm a former PHP user, I used to develop most of the big site with PHP, Its MySQL databases got corrupted as moving local machines then moved on and switched to Node.js but unfortunately, I lost most of its PHP files to be published on GitHub as a Git repository since sticking with Modern version of my portfolio site.
## Ever heard of Cloud Computing?
I have experienced working with Cloud Computing, with Amazon Web Services comes in handy, it also powers my site. Due to my financial issues to run my site properly, I can't learn it fast and it costs much more since it wasn't free for beginners. Firebase on the other hand keeps on having a bandwidth issues.
## Are you available for hire in jobs?
Freelancer? Yep, I am a freelancer, open to some jobs for it right now, message me for any requirements. Thanks!
## Are you a solo developer?
Yes, I've been working on my portfolio site from 2017 to now all by myself, I am proud to see it can be seen worldwide and many people are exploring on my site.
## Besides coding, what have you learned?
- Video editing, I mostly love doing this as my outside hobby and probably takes more time to see the final project.
- Simple Motion graphics, A low budget motion graphics can do the trick.
- Simple Art and Animation, I'm not a smooth animator and an artist, just simple drawing since I don't have much time for arts.
- Electronics, I am into making prototypes, just a bread board
- Cooking, I assume this is a joke but seriously, I just like cooking for my source of energy.
