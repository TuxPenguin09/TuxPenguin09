# About Me
## Heyo, It's TuxPenguin09 (aliamanuba on hodots.)
### Just your average advanced web developer.
I mostly work more on my web project [hodots.](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/hodotsnet) and its [core behind it](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/hodotsAPI).
If you wish to see it's code, you can contact me anytime (except midnight since it's private). You can contribute my second version front-end for hodots. here at [hodots. Remagine Design](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/hodotsnet-remagine).

If you wish to see my work in progress site, [its here and its free to register!](https://hodots.com) 
(Note: its still in beta, bugs may occur during the go. Due to its financial issues, My site only runs in public every weekends (London, UK Time))
