# Personally About Me
## TuxPenguin09 on some old sites and aliamanuba on any site, my real name is „É¢„É™„ÉÑ
### Just your average advanced full-stack developer.
I mostly work more on my portfolio project and its core behind it.

You can also contribute to my portfolio site documentation for developers for developing an application in my portfolio site, [hodots. Documentations for Developers](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/hodots-docs).
How about [my soon to be a game engine](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/incogine) and it's [now unmaintained multipurpose code editor](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/incogine-editor), or my [self-hosted chatroom's server](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/decensha) it's clients are going open-source soon, also my work in progress [office/learning management system](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/roomital), the other one I am working on today such as [Statolumn](https://statolumn.com) (unlike hodots., Statolumn requires an account to interact), not planning on open source them except for it's [locale which can be found here](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/statolumn-locale).

If you wish to see my portfolio site which I don't personally promote to anyone, [its here and its free to register!](https://hodots.com), also [another one of my portfolio site](https://statolumn.com)
(Note: its still in beta, bugs may occur during the site ongoing.)

I am really proud of this being launched worldwide since I was 16 (back in Feb, 2021), It's also the right time for me to learn much about how hosting a website and most of the cybersecurity and vulnerability check and testing everything in production. Statolumn launched back in Aug. 2024 before I turned 20 in September, which makes it the last among 2 of my portfolio projects and sites as a teenager.
