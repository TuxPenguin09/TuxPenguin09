# About Me
## Heyo, It's TuxPenguin09 (aliamanuba on any site) and just my true name is Moritz
### Just your average advanced full-stack developer.
I mostly work more on my portfolio project and its core behind it.

You can also contribute to my portfolio site documentation for developers for developing an application in my portfolio site, [hodots. Documentations for Developers](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/hodots-docs).
How about my multipurpose [code editor](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/incogine-editor), or my [self-hosted chatroom's server](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/decensha) it's clients are going open-source soon, also my work in progress [office/learning management system](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/roomital).

If you wish to see my portfolio site which I don't personally promote to anyone, [its here and its free to register!](https://hodots.com)
(Note: its still in beta, bugs may occur during the site ongoing.)

I am really proud of this being launched worldwide since I was 16 (back in Feb, 2021), It's also the right time for me to learn much about how hosting a website and most of the cybersecurity and vulnerability check and testing everything in production.

I have made another application or a portfolio site coming 2024.
# Questions Answered
## Programming Languages I knew?

- I'm a former PHP user, I used to develop most of the big site with PHP, Its MySQL databases got corrupted as moving local machines then moved on and switched to Node.js but unfortunately, I lost most of its PHP files to be published on GitHub as a Git repository since sticking with Modern version of my portfolio site.
## Full-stack Development I knew?
- MongoDB, React, Node.js

When it comes to frontend web development, I am always with React. It depends on backend web development though, using the right tool for the job.
## Ever heard of Cloud Computing?
I have experienced working with Cloud Computing, with Amazon Web Services comes in handy, it also powers my site. Due to my financial issues to run my site properly, I can't learn it fast and it costs much more since it wasn't free for beginners. Firebase on the other hand keeps on having a bandwidth issues.

## Besides coding, what have you learned?
- Video editing, I mostly love doing this as my outside hobby and probably takes more time to see the final project.
- Simple Motion graphics, A low budget motion graphics can do the trick.

- Electronics, I am into making prototypes, just a bread board
