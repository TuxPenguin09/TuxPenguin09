## Heyo, It's TuxPenguin09 (aliamanuba on hodots.)
### Just your average advanced web developer.
I mostly work more on my web project [hodots.](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/hodotsnet) and its [core behind it](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/hodotsAPI).

## Programming Languages I knew?
Also I highly love JavaScript as my main programming language for developing sites. <br />
I used to do C# from the past 2017 for my game development. <br />
Learning C++ for my game engine from scratch. <br />
