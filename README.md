### Just your average advanced web developer.
I mostly work more on my web project [hodots.](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/hodotsnet) and its [core behind it](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/hodotsAPI).
If you wish to see it's code, you can contact me anytime (except midnight since it's private). You can contribute my second version front-end for hodots. here at [hodots. Remagine Design](https://github.com/leafstudiosDot/hodotsnet-remagine).

## Ever heard of Cloud Computing?
I have experienced working with Cloud Computing, with Amazon Web Services comes in handy, it also powers my site. Due to my financial issues to run my site properly, I can't learn it fast and it costs much more since it wasn't free for beginners.
